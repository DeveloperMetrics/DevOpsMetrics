            What am I looking at?
            Deployment Frequency is a high performing DevOps metric. This page helps us to measure it across various projects in both Azure DevOps and GitHub
            - How does it work? We look at the number of successful pipeline runs
            - Assumptions/things we can't currently measure: The build is multi-stage - and leads to a deployment in a production environment. We only look at the master branch, ignoring feature branches (as these probably aren't deploying to production')
