        <b>FAQ</b><br />
        <b>What am I looking at?</b><br />
        Deployment Frequency is a high performing DevOps metric to measure the number of deployments to production. This page helps us to measure it across various projects in both Azure DevOps and GitHub<br />
        <b>How does it work?</b><br />
        We look at the number of successful pipeline runs<br />
        <b>Assumptions/things we can't currently measure:</b><br />
        - The build is multi-stage, and leads to a deployment in a production environment.<br />
        - We only look at a single branch (usually the master branch), hence we ignore feature branches (as these probably aren't deploying to production')<br />
